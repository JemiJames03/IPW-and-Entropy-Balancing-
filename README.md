# IPW-and-Entropy-Balancing-
This study investigates the employment and earnings outcomes of Master’s postgraduates from English Higher Education providers, utilizing the Longitudinal Education Outcomes (LEO) dataset for the 2014/15 to 2020/21 tax years. The research focuses on analyzing earnings differentials across domicile groups (UK, EU, and Non-EU) and genders, at one, three, five, and ten years after graduation. Preliminary analysis reveals persistent gender pay gaps across all domicile groups. To address potential biases arising from suppressed and missing data, particularly among international graduates, Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and Entropy Balancing are employed. The methodology incorporates a Weighted Least Squares regression model, utilizing entropy balancing weights to ensure covariate balance across treatment groups. This approach allows for a robust analysis of earnings differences, accounting for domicile status, gender, years after graduation, and subject of study. The model also includes interaction terms to capture the nuanced relationships between these variables. This research aims to provide valuable insights into the long-term labour market outcomes of Master’s graduates in the UK. The findings have important implications for higher education policy, international student recruitment, and efforts to address gender disparities in postgraduate labour markets
